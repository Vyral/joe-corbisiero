Happy New Year\! Can you believe it’s 2022? With the new year comes plenty of new opportunities, so I would love to help you find your dream home in 2022.

**I am an expert in investment properties.** I can help you handle capital gains and purchase properties that will generate a lot of revenue. I can also help you buy a second home that you plan on enjoying on the weekends.

**If you want to buy a new primary residence, I encourage you to take advantage of our low interest rates** in 2022. You may have heard that the Federal Reserve plans on raising interest rates going forward, so now is the time to lock in a great rate for 20 to 30 years.

I can give you all the data and financial planning you need to make your dream come true. If you’re planning on buying a home or investment property, call me at 757-773-0023. I would love to see your smile when I hand you the keys to your new home.
