Are you a homeowner in San Diego County who has thought of putting your home on the market, but you’re not sure if it’s the right time? Well, I’m sure you’ve heard that it’s been a crazy, seller-driven year here in San Diego and across the nation, so today I’ll share five reasons why the holiday season is an amazing time to sell your home:

**1\. You can use your decorations to your advantage.** Holiday decorations are festive and sure to warm your potential buyers’ hearts. Appealing to the emotionality of the season will draw in buyers and entice them to make an incredible offer on your property.

**2\. You’ll have less competition.** Because it’s the holidays, many sellers will postpone putting their homes on the market until next spring. That means there will be less inventory on the market and more buyers’ eyes on your prize.&nbsp;

**3\. Prices are higher.** Because of the lack of inventory and the number of qualified buyers still in the market for homes, sellers are able to fetch higher prices for their properties. According to the National Association of Realtors, homes for sale in this market have received an average of 3.7 offers before getting one accepted.

**4\. You’ll see a greater return on your investment.** The crazy amount of appreciation we’ve experienced over the last year means that you’re bound to get even more than you thought you would for the sale of your home. More equity for you means more money in your pocket and for the down payment on your next home.

**5\. You’re more likely to get great terms due to buyer fatigue.** Many buyers are tired of looking for properties, and at this point, they’re so willing to do whatever it takes to get their offers accepted. That means buyers may be willing to give you a free rent-back, pay for your closing costs, and other perks to win your home.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that if selling your home has even crossed your mind, get in touch with your Realtor and talk about what it would be like to sell your home this holiday season.
