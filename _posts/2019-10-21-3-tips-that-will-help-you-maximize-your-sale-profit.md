<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Want to maximize the profit from your home sale? Follow these three tips.</em></p>

As a home seller, there are three important tips you must remember if you want to maximize the profit from your sale.&nbsp;

First, and most importantly, **showcase it in the best light possible.** Put yourself in a buyer’s shoes: They’ve got a family to take care of and they’re probably very busy, so they just want to find a home that feels like home. They don’t want something they have to invest a ton of money into or fix up—just a place where they can move right in. Here at the Dream Homes Team, we have several programs you can take advantage of that will boost your home’s curb appeal.

Next, **have your home staged.** Most sellers don’t know how to arrange their furniture when listing their home, so having yours professionally staged takes care of this problem for you. This is another service we offer on our team.&nbsp;

Lasly, **have a professional photographer take photos and video of your home.** Video, especially, is the present and the future. People want to see videos of homes so they can get a good feel of how they flow from room to room. If your home features good video, buyers will show up to it already “sold.”
