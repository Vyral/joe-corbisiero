Can’t afford to upgrade your home before listing? Here are your options.

So you’ve thought about selling your San Diego home but it needs some work first. Generally speaking, homes that are in impeccable condition sell for more than homes that need a little work. By “need a little work,” I mean your property could use a paint job, bathroom/kitchen remodel, roof or foundation repair, etc.&nbsp;

**What if you don’t have the funds to make these upgrades? Here are your options.&nbsp;**

The first is a program we offer called **Compass Concierge.** With this program, if you have enough equity in your home, I’ll front the money to you to pay for the upgrades. I’ll also find vendors I know and trust to do the work. This will allow you to net way more money when you sell. Obviously, I know this can be a slight discomfort because you’ll have to rearrange your furniture so the work can get done and deal with people moving in and out of your home. However, I still highly recommend considering this option because I’ve seen properties sit on the mart for a *long* time just because the owner neglected to do a simple paint job or something similar.&nbsp;

Making upgrades may seem like a lot to undertake, but if you spend as little as $5,000 to $8,000, you can get a return of $20,000, $30,000, or even $40,000. I’d love to show you how, so give me a call and I’d be happy to schedule a virtual or in-home consultation.

Your second option is to **sell to an iBuyer.** iBuyers are companies or investors that purchase homes for cash. You won’t get as much money selling this way as you would by listing your home on the open market, though, and that’s because these iBuyers need to make a return on their investment as well. This is a business, after all—not everyone can afford to put $500,000 into a home and not make any money in return once they sell it.&nbsp;

If your home has serious issues, I recommend selling to an iBuyer. Unfortunately, some homes are so old or in such bad shape that they're simply not financeable. I buy homes for cash as well, so I’d be happy to give you as much money for your home as possible based on its condition so you can move on with your life.&nbsp;

**Our team also offers complimentary staging,** so if you decide to work with us and put your home on the open market, we’ll furnish it for free. We’ll also do everything else in our power to prepare your home for the market (photos, video, pre-inspections, etc.) and showcase it in the best light possible on all the major real estate websites.&nbsp;

At the end of the day, my goal is to make as much money for you as possible when selling your home. If you’d like to talk more about this topic or have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
