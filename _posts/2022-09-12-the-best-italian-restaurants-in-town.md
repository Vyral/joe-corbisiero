What’s my favorite Italian restaurant here in San Diego? That’s a hard question since my husband and I are both tough critics. Despite our high standards, we do have a few go-to Italian restaurants:

1. **Cesarina in Point Loma.** Their eggplant parmigiana is the best, and they have a cute atmosphere.
2. **Caff&egrave; Calabria near North Park.** If you’re looking for great pizza, Caff&egrave; Calabria has the best crust in the city, and you can’t go wrong with their menu.
3. **Ciccia Osteria in Barrio Logan.** We love the owners, and the environment is amazing.&nbsp;

All of these places are outstanding. Give them a try if you’re in the mood for some great Italian\! As always, if you have any real estate questions, feel free to call or email us. We’d love to help.
