Many people have reached out to me recently to ask if now is still a good time to buy or sell a home. Interest rates have indeed made buying a new home a little tougher, but that isn’t the full story.

For example, homeowners have gained a ton of equity over the last few years, and that equity is going to be huge when buying a new home. It's going to give you purchasing power. It’s true that people are no longer fighting over themselves for new houses like they used to, but that means you’ll have less competition once you hit the market.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

**Right now is a perfect time for sellers that are not in a rush to sell their houses.** Now, you won’t be rushed to sell your house and immediately purchase a new one. You can take your time and find the home of your dreams; you’ll likely receive a great deal, too.&nbsp;

Right now, you can use 100% of your equity to buy your next home, which will allow you to have lower payments. Overall, although the rates are not at record lows at the moment, they are still near the historical average.&nbsp;

So in short, now is still a great time to make a move if that’s what you want to do. Call or email me if you have any questions about this topic or something else. I am always willing to help!
