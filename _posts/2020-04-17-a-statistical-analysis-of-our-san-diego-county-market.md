<p style="text-align: center;"><em>2020 was off to a fiery start in the market, but then the unexpected happened. Here’s what you need to know about the state of our housing market.</em></p>

I hope you and your family are safe at home and making the most out of your time.&nbsp; Recently, I’ve been pulling up a ton of data, analyzing different metrics, and watching top economists. Today I’m sharing a report I compiled using the latest info from our San Diego County market in the past two to three weeks. Around the middle of March, our pending sales for 2020 (roughly 3,500) mirrored the levels of 2017, which was one of the best years in the history of our market. Since then, of course, pending sales have dropped dramatically as COVID-19 spread. However, this is actually nothing to be scared about if you understand our housing supply situation. To hear more about what I mean, watch my latest video above.&nbsp;
