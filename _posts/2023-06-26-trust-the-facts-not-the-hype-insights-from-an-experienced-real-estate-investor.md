Today, I am excited to share with you an eye-opening perspective on the real estate market that will leave you amazed. Cast your mind back to 2005, a year that brought significant challenges for many homeowners. It was a time of dramatic collapses and heartbreaking stories as the real estate industry experienced a major downturn. Fast forward to 2007 and 2008, when everything came crashing down, leaving lasting scars. However, there's an intriguing twist: those who had the foresight to purchase properties in 2005 and managed to weather the storm without losing their homes are now reaping substantial rewards in the form of equity.

Let's dive deeper into the numbers. In August 2005, during the market peak, the median sales price was $512,000. In April 2022, we hit another peak, with the median price soaring to $855,000. **That's an astounding 66% increase.** When you crunch the numbers, it becomes evident that real estate has provided an average appreciation of 3.8% per year over the past 17 years, considering the various factors and fluctuations that have shaped the market.

However, that's not all. Let's take a closer look at the market's rollercoaster ride. In December 2022, we witnessed a temporary drop, hitting a bottom with an average price of $749,000 in San Diego County. However, from that point onward, **the market made a remarkable recovery, rising by 9% from December 2022 to April 2023.** These figures speak for themselves, backed by solid statistics and insights from reputable economists and real estate investors.

With real estate, it's crucial to seek advice from professionals with real skin in the game rather than relying on random YouTube videos. **Trust the guidance of experienced advisors and individuals actively involved in the real estate market.** Remember, each market is unique, so if you have any questions or are specifically interested in real estate in San Diego or Riverside County, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
