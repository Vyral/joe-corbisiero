It’s time to cover the last two steps of the 10-step process of buying a home: closing (aka recording) and post-closing. Joining me today for this discussion is agent Javier Hernandez.

**During the closing, the title company officially records the property under your name.** At that moment, you’re officially a homeowner\! For us Realtors, handing over the keys at post-closing is the most beautiful and rewarding part of the whole transaction&nbsp;

If you’re a first-time homebuyer, it’s a good idea to get familiar with disclosures at this point in the sale. These include a lot of information, and there are several involved in a transaction, such as the seller property questionnaire. If you’re familiar with this disclosure, you already know what to expect once you’re in escrow. You also have documents like the natural hazard disclosure, which discloses what the property is naturally surrounded by, and the transfer disclosure, which tells you what the property is being transferred with (stove, refrigerator, etc.).

**Knowing what each of these disclosures entails will make this step of the home-buying process easier.** Not every agent will go over these with you, so feel free to reach out to me or Javier to learn more about them.

Moving forward, you can expect to see more videos like this that dive deeper into each step of the home-buying process. Next time, for example, we’ll cover the residential purchase agreement and go line by line as we explain what it means to purchase a home. We’ll also show you the tools you need so you’re not going into a home purchase blindfolded. In the future, we’ll also go over the most important disclosures you should pay attention to in the process.

In the meantime, if you have questions about today’s topic or there’s anything else we can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to speak with you.
