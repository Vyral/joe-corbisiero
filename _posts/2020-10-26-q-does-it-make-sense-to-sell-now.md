Here are my thoughts on selling a home now versus waiting for spring.

You’ve probably heard a bunch of conflicting information about our market, so I’m here to clear things up and give you the facts. Speculation is speculation and numbers are numbers.&nbsp;

**Our team continues to help clients buy and sell homes day after day.** We have buyers, sellers, investors, and other real estate professionals who are buying and selling real estate.

We are in a very strong seller’s market right now. We have a limited supply of homes, and demand is high. There are about 63% fewer homes on the market now than we had in September 2019. That’s a huge dropoff and demonstrates just how low our supply is. In the same period, sales remained flat even though there were so many fewer homes to choose from.

There’s never a “perfect” time to buy or sell. **Timing the market doesn’t work.** What does work is taking advantage of current market conditions to cash out on your equity, and put it into something bigger and better. If you bump up into the luxury market, there’s a bit more supply to choose from. I’m almost positive that the election will have some impact on this luxury market.

If you have any questions for me about buying or selling a home in this kind of market, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
