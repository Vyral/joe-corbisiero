<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I talked to a group of real estate pros about the importance of data.</em></p>

I recently gave a presentation for the San Diego Real Producers’ Mastermind Zoom series about the importance of data when analyzing the real estate market and prospecting for clients.

**Here’s a timestamped outline of the discussion so you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you the most:**

0:55 — How data and real stories work together to help clients make decisions about buying or selling

1:45 — The future of the real estate market boils down to a few specific data points

3:00 —ShowingTime data and trends that show we’re back on track

4:45 — A look at the San Diego County expected market time year over year

6:00 —&nbsp; Why interest rates should be an emphasis for buyers

7:15 — The wrong mindset that most prospects have about this market and how you can change it

8:10 — Wrapping things up

If you have questions for me about the current state of the real estate market or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
