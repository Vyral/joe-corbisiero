Since the market here in San Diego County (and pretty much all markets across the country) has been such an extreme seller’s market, many buyers are having serious difficulties in getting their offers accepted. Inventory levels are drastically low, and many agents across the nation have been running at least 12 offers before a seller accepts. Fortunately, we at the Dream Homes Team have put together a strategy that will help buyers get their offers accepted. Today I’ll break it down for you by walking you through a residential purchase agreement (RPA) and showing you what we do to increase your chances of winning a bidding war.
