Today we wanted to briefly go over what happens during the home-buying process for those of you not familiar. First, you need to connect with a knowledgeable and reliable real estate agent in your buying market (**we hope you’ll choose us if you’re buying in San Diego\!**). Your agent will help you get started with the pre-approval process. The pre-approval will determine your maximum budget for a new home.&nbsp;

Once you receive that letter from your lender or local bank, you can start shopping for houses. Your agent will send you the information on homes with open houses or private showings available, and you’ll go see the ones you like best. Once you fall in love with a home, it’s time to make an offer, which your agent will write for you. Once you get an offer accepted, you’ll go into escrow, and that’s the time when you’ll do a home inspection, an appraisal, and finish your fully underwritten loan process.&nbsp;

Once all that’s done, you’ll get a clear to close from escrow, and **they’ll send a notary to your workplace or current home so you can start signing all the necessary documents.** Once it’s been recorded that you’ve signed all the documents, you can pick up your keys, or your agent will bring them to you. Then it’s time to move into your new home\!&nbsp;
