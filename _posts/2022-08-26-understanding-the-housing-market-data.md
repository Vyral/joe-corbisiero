Have you ever been confused by the media showing a lot of contradicting views of the housing market? In my opinion, a lot of it shouldn’t be trusted, and it’s important to go back to the original source. I have collected critical market data from trusted sources, and I’m sharing them with you today so you can be informed and updated.&nbsp;

**You can hear all the details by watching the video above or skip to individual topics using these timestamps:&nbsp;**

0:00 — Introduction&nbsp;

2:01 — The data and what resources say&nbsp;

3:13 — Inventory and pending sales&nbsp;

4:17 — Explaining the decrease in sales and the increase in rent&nbsp;

5:13 — The declining number of sales after the peak&nbsp;

5:53 — Why it’s a good time to purchase a home

7:57 — An analysis of the news&nbsp;

9:06 — A seller’s market vs. a buyer’s market&nbsp;

10:21 — Recession and interest rates&nbsp;

11:46 — Wrapping up&nbsp;

All that being said, I first want to say that if you’re in the market, I recommend you buy now. Secondly, I advise everyone to be well-informed by trusted sources. If you have any questions about this stuff, call or text my team or me anytime. We would love to hear from you\!&nbsp;
