Today I have some great news for home buyers. I just spoke to my partners at Cardinal Financial, and they have this new program that aligns with our name: the Dreams for All program. This incredible opportunity is for those of you who haven't owned a home for the past three years at least.

This is a basic **down payment assistance program that will give you 20% down.** You need a minimum of a 665 FICO credit score, and the maximum income for the household should be $211,000. Also, you cannot have owned a home for the last three years, and they can go up to 50% of the debt-to-income ratio.

For example, for a $600,000 purchase, if you use this program, which is a 20% down payment assistance, you will be spending $750 less every month than you would with an FHA loan.

What's the catch? **Well, there is no catch.** If you have at least $13,000, you can qualify for this loan. You need a verifiable income with a W-2â€”this doesn't apply to 1089 people. So if you have a pay stub and a job, you can qualify for a loan with downpayment assistance. So if you'd like to know more details, feel free to call or email me. I would be happy to walk you through the details.
