Our San Diego County market is still strong, and now is a great time to buy.&nbsp;

Amid the COVID-19 lockdown, today’s market update is a message of positivity.

I first want to say that my family and I are alive, have a roof under our heads, and have food in the refrigerator. Therefore, I consider us blessed. There are a lot of people who are worse off than we are, but we’re all in this together.

Things are changing quite quickly in our San Diego County market, but **from April 16 to April 23, there were 549 homes pending and 656 active listings,** which tells us that our market is still strong.&nbsp;

At 3:09 in the video above, you can see a ShowingTime graph depicting the impact COVID-19 has had on home showings in California. On March 5, showings were up 32% compared to the same time in 2019. Then the pandemic hit, and by March 25, showings had plummeted 65.7%. From March 28 to April 22, though, they increased 35%.

With home showings increasing as drastically as they are, that’s a good sign, and with interest rates still low (3% to 3.25%), **there’s a short window of opportunity to buy now.** If you still have a job and were thinking of buying before the pandemic hit, make your purchase. Don’t think about what may or may not happen in the future.&nbsp;

Here in California, we’re similarly blessed as far as the health of our real estate market goes, and there are still a lot of job opportunities out there. As soon as the lockdown is lifted, it will still take a month or two for everyone to recuperate mentally and many former employees to get rehired by their former employers.&nbsp;

So to reiterate, the time to buy is now.
