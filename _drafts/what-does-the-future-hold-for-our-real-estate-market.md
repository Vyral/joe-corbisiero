What can you expect from the San Diego real estate market in 2020? Here are my predictions.

On the latest episode of Real Estate Rundown, Bill Griffith and I talked about the future of real estate.&nbsp;

**In 2020, San Diego will be the fastest-growing real estate market in the state, according to a number of different experts and economists.** There are more job opportunities coming in, and San Diego is a cheaper place to live compared to San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.&nbsp;

**We’re projecting a growth of 2% to 3% in the state of California, while the projections for San Diego are near 4%.&nbsp;**

Is it a good time to buy or sell? Based on what’s going on right now, I can say this: Interest rates are still low and it’s always a good time to buy when you want to become a homeowner. **As long as you are comfortable with your monthly payment and your interest rate is low, go for it.**

Real estate sales have become more like car sales recently in the fact that you can actually sell your house with the click of a button online. However, there’s so much that goes into selling a home that these companies don’t know. They will buy your house for cash, but I don’t recommend selling it to them. You could lose a lot of money and leave a lot on the table that way.

If you have any questions for me, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
