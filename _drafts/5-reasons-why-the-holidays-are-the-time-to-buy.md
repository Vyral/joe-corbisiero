You can find a great deal on a home during the holidays. Here are five reasons why.

Why wait for spring when the holiday months are the perfect time to buy a home? There are five reasons why a home purchase makes perfect sense during the holidays:

**1\. You have more buying power.** The homes that didn’t sell over the summer are still on the market. Sellers are more likely to take a lower price so they can finally get their properties sold.

**2\. Less competition.** Since few people know that the winter months are a good time to buy, you’ll face less competition from other buyers. In the spring and summer, the market is saturated with buyers, which leads to more demand for homes.

**3\. Take advantage of tax season.** Sellers want to make a sale before tax season rolls around. If they’re selling an investment property, they’ll have to report a loss or a profit. They’ll be more willing to make a price cut now to avoid a gain in 2020.

**4\. Sellers are more serious.** Not many people want to deal with selling their home during the busy holiday season. When people do choose to sell during this time, it indicates that they’re motivated to make a sale. If they’re desperate to move, you can negotiate a great price.

**5\. You can see the home’s condition in bad weather.** We usually see more rain in December, which can show how a home handles inclement weather. You’re better able to see a home at its worst (and avoid making a potentially problematic purchase). Issues like leaky roofs and gutters mean that you have extra room for negotiation.
