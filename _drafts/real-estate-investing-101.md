Here’s what you need to know to get your real estate investment portfolio started.

Perhaps you’ve heard this tried-and-true saying: “You’ll never go broke investing in San Diego real estate.” Real estate investment is one of the reasons I moved to San Diego 12 years ago.&nbsp;

When it comes to determining whether you should leap into real estate investing, there are two main things to look at:&nbsp;

**1\. Cash flow.** When you take the rent you’re charging tenants minus the mortgage, taxes, maintenance, etc., what’s left?&nbsp;

**2\. Appreciation.** What is the percentage, year over year, that the value of the property appreciates? How quickly are you building equity?&nbsp;

You can invest in all sorts of properties, but in my opinion, forget about condominiums—they tend to have homeowners associations, adding another layer of complexity to your strategy; I also recommend two to four units. If they’re strictly used for cash flow purposes, they typically require a 25% down payment.

Appreciation will happen regardless—San Diego is a great market. But the cash flow in some areas (often referred to as “less desirable” areas, or gentrifying areas) will be way less than others.&nbsp;

In gentrified areas, you’ll have higher cash flow and a little less appreciation, but that’s your retirement plan. If you’re looking for a place to live or your next investment property, feel free to reach out by phone or email. I’m more than happy to help.
