Today we want to talk about the state of the housing market. We're currently seeing mortgage interest rates increase, and that’s likely to continue throughout the year. We're also seeing inventory levels finally rising for the first time in eight months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This is great news for buyers.

Many of you might be thinking that because we're seeing more homes on the market and rising interest rates, prices will drop. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case. **Home prices will continue to rise because of the supply and demand situation.** We simply don't have enough homes hitting the market to fulfill buyers’ needs.

If you're interested in getting into the housing market, the best time to do it is now. Give us a call, and let's get you into your next home. We look forward to hearing from you.
